        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>We love creating memories through the great sport of whitewater rafting. Through the website, now potential
            customers can browse different activites, see pricing, and book their rafting trip without having to call
            our office or book in person. It will make our business more accessible to more people. Along with
            accessibility, our website will provide more visibility for the business. It will appear in online searches,
            and we can spread the word on other platforms, linking the posts or advertisements to this website. </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Who are the target customers? Describe their life (or business) situation (age, financial situation,
            interests, and so on)
            Our target customers are all adventurous people. This includes families looking for a fun vacation, or
            friends who want a quick weekend getaway. Since we offer low cost rafting adventures, our customers will be
            from all financial backgrounds.
            How will my audience usually access my site (desktop, laptop, mobile device)?
            The audience will usually access this site from a desktop computer, but they are also able to access it from
            a desktop and mobile device.
            What do they expect to find or what questions will be answered by them accessing the website?
            The audience expects to find descriptions of different rafting adventures as well as pricing. There will
